# üéØ Crystal Cave Adventure - Cheat Sheet

This document contains all the answers to challenges in the Crystal Cave Adventure game. Use this for educational purposes or if you get stuck!

> **UI Note (2025-07-04):** The score/traits bar is now a three-column grid (Score | Characteristics | Artifacts) with a _separate horizontally scrollable artifact row_ directly underneath. All answers below remain unchanged.
> **Update ‚Äì 2025-07-06:** The UI was polished (vertical choice buttons, narrower stats bar, confetti on artifact collection, and a real back button).  The answer system now accepts synonyms and fuzzy-matched words, so minor typos or close variants still pass.  The canonical answers are listed below.
